# Playfair-Cipher
Using a playfair Cipher, you can encrypt and decrypt messages.

### How to run the program
Go into the [cipher folder](https://github.com/STOzaki/Playfair-Cipher/blob/master/cipher), then run the encryption.sh (type ./encryption.sh in your terminal), which will take whatever you have in the message.txt and encrypt it.  The output will be stored in the encrypted file.  Afterwards, if you run the decryption.sh (./decryption.sh), it will take encrypted.txt and out put the your message.

### Programming aspect
[This](https://github.com/STOzaki/Playfair-Cipher/blob/master/cipher/encryption.sh) runs the bash script that encrypts the message file through the appropriate programs.
[This](https://github.com/STOzaki/Playfair-Cipher/blob/master/cipher/encryption.c) is the encryption code.
[This](https://github.com/STOzaki/Playfair-Cipher/blob/master/cipher/decryption.sh) runs the bash script that decrypts the encrypted message through the proper program.
[This](https://github.com/STOzaki/Playfair-Cipher/blob/master/cipher/decryption.c) is the decryption code.

##### Warning
I must warn you though, I could not find a way to reverse the extra X and J turned into I.
