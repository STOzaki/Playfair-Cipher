# Playfair-Cipher
Using a playfair Cipher, you can encrypt and decrypt messages.

### How to run the program
Go into the cipher folder, then run the encryption.sh (type ./encryption.sh in your terminal), which will take whatever you have in the message.txt and encrypt it.  The output will be stored in the encrypted file.  Afterwards, if you run the decryption.sh (./decryption.sh), it will take encrypted.txt and out put the your message.

##### Warning
I must warn you though, I could not find a way to deal with the extra X and J turned into I.
